# üèóÔ∏è Implement Shopping List Item Deletion

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an online shopper, I want to be able to remove items from my list.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when each item's Remove button can be clicked to remove its respective shopping list item.

## üí° Hints

* Use your knowledge in DOM traversal to select an element's parent.

* The jQuery method for deleting an element is `.remove()`.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed the activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some alternatives to using jQuery? 
Here are some alternatives to using jQuery:

1. **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Modern JavaScript provides many of the same utilities as jQuery without the need for an additional library.
2. **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
3. **Vue.js:** A progressive framework for building user interfaces, similar to React but with a different approach to component architecture.
4. **Angular:** A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
5. **Svelte:** A compiler that converts your app into highly efficient vanilla JavaScript at build time.
6. **Lodash:** A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance, and extras beyond jQuery's utility functions.
7. **Alpine.js:** A minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior directly in your HTML.

These alternatives provide various levels of functionality, performance benefits, and modern approaches to handling DOM manipulation and state management.

Discuss the merits with your partner. You can read this [guide to whether you need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) to learn about some alternatives.
